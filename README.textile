h1. Idler Framework

h2. What is this?

This repository contains a project for the capstone of the gaming major at Pennsylvania College of Technology.

The goal of the project was to create an application in a few weeks which assisted game developers in creating *Idler* games.

h3. Technology (Requirements)

- CoffeeScript := one of the requirement was a new language, since CoffeeScript was foreign to me, it fit the bill.
- Mithril := Mithril was a UI framework that I have never used before. It is very lean and was quick to learn. I believe that the API of Mithril at the time I used it contained only 15 public methods!
- Superagent := handles AJAX requests.
- Handlebars := uses templates to generate .CS code.
- Webpack := the build system used to deploy the application.

h3. Research

The whole process of creating a web application was new to me. Almost all aspects of this project contributed to the research portion of the project.

h4. Post-Mortem

For the most part, the project was a success. The front-end was done in under a week, while the back-end was done in a few days. In the beginning of the semester, I started out with React, but ran into a few errors that brought the project to a grinding halt. About halfway through I switched to Mithril.

The project did what I planned it to do. There was no compromises made. I set the bar pretty low, but it was high enough to be impressive to my fellow students and professors.

I no longer use most of the technology used in this project. While I still use Restify, I usually do most of it by hand. I have had no need for an ORM. Most of my API routes now follow a good (and mostly sane) structure. Most front-end work I do is either in Vue or React (as of the start of 2017). React alongside MobX is very close to what Mithril is.

For a two week-long project, I am happy with what this program came to be. It's very rough and messy, but it worked for everyone's needs.
