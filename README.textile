h1. Idler Framework

h2. What is this?

This repository contains a project for the capstone of the gaming major at Pennsylvania College of Technology.

The goal of the project was to create an application in a few weeks which assisted game developers in creating *Idler* games.

h3. Technology (Requirements)

- CoffeeScript := one of the requirement was a new language, since CoffeeScript was foreign to me, it fit the bill.
- Mithril := Mithril was a UI framework that I have never used before. It is very lean and was quick to learn. I believe that the API of Mithril at the time I used it contained only 15 public methods!
- Superagent := handles AJAX requests.
- Handlebars := uses templates to generate .CS code.
- Webpack := the build system used to deploy the application.

h3. Research

The whole process of creating a web application was new to me. Almost all aspects of this project contributed to the research portion of the project.
